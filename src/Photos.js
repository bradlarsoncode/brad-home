    'Like the rest of America, I've been making a lot of bread over the past year. A couple of years ago, I bought a counter-top flour mill. When you mill your 
    own flour, the nutrients and oils that are stripped out of store bought flour stay in. These difference make you have to rethink your approach - you can't just substitute it into recipes and
    get the same results. Of all the types of bread I've made since March 2020, this one is by far my favorite. It uses a mix of hard winter wheat (nutty flavor), rye berries (savory notes), and is
    sweetened with molasses. I love this bread lightly toasted with a little bit of butter. But it's fine by itself, too.'`,

    A cup of tea on my couch with my dog and a book of poetry. A sweet treat completed the ritual... So, I'd like 
    to share some of my favorite teas, a simple short bread, and a poem that spoke to me this year. Enjoy!'`,
