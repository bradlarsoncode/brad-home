    other pieces that she would be deeply disappointed by. 
    Right before the pandemic hit I started branching out into embroidery. Over the course of the pandemic, I've completed a number of embroidery and cross stitch kits. 
    It especially helped keep me occupied in the beginning of lockdown when everything had just been turned upside down. Because I have the drawing skill of the average 4th grader, 
    I decided to experiment with mixed media to create my own embroidery pattern for this project. I stamped the hands on the fabric and free stitched the flowers using 
    some of the embroidery technique I've learned this past year. I like this piece because it makes me think of how in an incredibly dark year, the bright spots I had were always 
    grown out of friends reaching out to share their love, hope, and support. '`,

    'Like the rest of America, I've been making a lot of bread over the past year. A couple of years ago, I bought a counter-top flour mill. When you mill your 
    own flour, the nutrients and oils that are stripped out of store bought flour stay in. These difference make you have to rethink your approach - you can't just substitute it into recipes and
    get the same results. Of all the types of bread I've made since March 2020, this one is by far my favorite. It uses a mix of hard winter wheat (nutty flavor), rye berries (savory notes), and is
    sweetened with molasses. I love this bread lightly toasted with a little bit of butter. But it's fine by itself, too.'`,
